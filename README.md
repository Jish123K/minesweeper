# minesweeper
We will create a Minesweeper game with a graphical user interface using the Pygame library. The game will allow the player to choose the difficulty level (number of rows, columns, and mines), and then they will need to clear the board without detonating any mines.

Steps:

Install Pygame library: Pygame is a popular library for creating games in Python. To install it, you can use the following command in your terminal: pip install pygame

Create a game window: We will create a game window using Pygame's display module. Set the window size and title, and then initialize the display.

Create a Minesweeper grid: Create a grid with the specified number of rows and columns. We will represent the cells in the grid using a two-dimensional list.

Add mines to the grid: Randomly select cells to add mines to the grid. We will use the random module to do this.

Calculate the number of adjacent mines for each cell: For each cell, calculate the number of adjacent mines. This will help the player determine where the mines are located.

Add graphics to the grid: Use Pygame's draw module to add graphics to the grid. Draw each cell as a rectangle and add text to represent the number of adjacent mines.

Handle user input: Use Pygame's event module to handle user input. Allow the player to click on a cell to clear it or flag it as a mine.

Implement game logic: When the player clicks on a cell, check if it contains a mine. If it does, end the game. If it doesn't, clear the cell and recursively clear any adjacent cells that do not contain mines. When all cells without mines are cleared, the player wins the game.

Add game over screen: When the game ends, display a game over screen. Allow the player to restart the game or quit.

Add sound effects: Add sound effects to the game using Pygame's mixer module. Add sound effects for clicking on cells, clearing cells, and detonating mines.

Test and debug the game: Test the game thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Debug any issues that you encounter.
